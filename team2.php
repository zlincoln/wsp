					<p>I got started with HG about 3 years ago well it was still in its infancy stages. From then it’s grown out of a dingy garage in downtown Burlington to a real shop. I am always trying to see how I can change my personal style to reflect in HG itself. Working with HG really allows everything we do on the snow reflect in the company itself.</p>

					<p>Yo what's good I'm Hunter Tyrrell and I'm a rider for HG skis. I started skiing when I was about 2 and was racing up until I was 11. I always had a love for freestyle skiing ever since I ditched my ski group to take park laps. The first couple of years for me consisted on expanding my bag of tricks and dialing them down consistently.</p>

Shout outs to the boys at HG, YMЯ, Dan at Arsenic Apparel, Ian at Kingdom Softwear, and all the friends and family that helped me along the way.</p>
